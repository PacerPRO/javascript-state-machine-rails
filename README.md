Javascript Finite State Machine (v2.2.0)
========================================

This gem provides [Jake Gordon](http://codeincomplete.com/)'s [Javascript
Finite State Machine
micro-framework](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine) for
the Rails asset pipeline.

Usage
-----

First, add this to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'javascript-state-machine-rails'

Run `bundle install` to install it, and then add this to your project's
Javascript manifest file (`app/assets/javascript/application.js`):

    //= require state_machine

After that you're ready to roll. The [upstream project's
README](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine) is a good
place to get started with some examples.
